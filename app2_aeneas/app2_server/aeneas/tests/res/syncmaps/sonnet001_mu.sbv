I

00:00:02.680,00:00:05.880
From fairest creatures
we desire increase,

00:00:05.880,00:00:09.240
That thereby beauty’s rose
might never die,

00:00:09.240,00:00:11.920
But as the riper
should by time decease,

00:00:11.920,00:00:15.280
His tender heir
might bear his memory:

00:00:15.280,00:00:18.560
But thou contracted
to thine own bright eyes,

00:00:18.560,00:00:22.800
Feed’st thy light’s flame
with self-substantial fuel,

00:00:22.800,00:00:25.640
Making a famine
where abundance lies,

00:00:25.640,00:00:31.240
Thy self thy foe,
to thy sweet self too cruel:

00:00:31.240,00:00:34.440
Thou that art now
the world’s fresh ornament,

00:00:34.440,00:00:36.960
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

00:00:36.960,00:00:40.680
Within thine own bud
buriest thy content,

00:00:40.680,00:00:43.640
And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:

00:00:43.640,00:00:48.520
Pity the world,
or else this glutton be,

00:00:48.520,00:00:53.240
To eat the world’s due,
by the grave and thee.

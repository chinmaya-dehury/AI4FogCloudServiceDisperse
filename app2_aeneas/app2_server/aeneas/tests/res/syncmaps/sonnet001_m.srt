2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,880
From fairest creatures
we desire increase,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,240
That thereby beauty's rose
might never die,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,920
But as the riper
should by time decease,

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,280
His tender heir
might bear his memory:

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,600
But thou contracted
to thine own bright eyes,

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
Feed'st thy light's flame
with self-substantial fuel,

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
Making a famine
where abundance lies,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,240
Thy self thy foe,
to thy sweet self too cruel:

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,280
Thou that art now
the world's fresh ornament,

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,960
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,680
Within thine own bud
buriest thy content,

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,560
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,080
Pity the world,
or else this glutton be,

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,240
To eat the world's due,
by the grave and thee.

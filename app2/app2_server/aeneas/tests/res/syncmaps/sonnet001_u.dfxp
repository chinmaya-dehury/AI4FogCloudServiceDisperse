      <p xml:id="f000003" begin="5.880s" end="9.240s">That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000004" begin="9.240s" end="11.920s">But as the riper should by time decease,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000005" begin="11.920s" end="15.280s">His tender heir might bear his memory:</p>
      <p xml:id="f000006" begin="15.280s" end="18.560s">But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000007" begin="18.560s" end="22.800s">Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,</p>

      <p xml:id="f000011" begin="34.440s" end="36.960s">And only herald to the gaudy spring,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000012" begin="36.960s" end="40.680s">Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000013" begin="40.680s" end="43.640s">And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:</p>
      <p xml:id="f000014" begin="43.640s" end="48.520s">Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000015" begin="48.520s" end="53.240s">To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.</p>

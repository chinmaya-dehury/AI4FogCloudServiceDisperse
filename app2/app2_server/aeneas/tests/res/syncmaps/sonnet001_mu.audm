2.680	5.880	From fairest creatures we desire increase,
5.880	9.240	That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,
9.240	11.920	But as the riper should by time decease,
11.920	15.280	His tender heir might bear his memory:
15.280	18.560	But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
18.560	22.800	Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,
22.800	25.640	Making a famine where abundance lies,
25.640	31.240	Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
31.240	34.440	Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,
34.440	36.960	And only herald to the gaudy spring,
36.960	40.680	Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
40.680	43.640	And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:
43.640	48.520	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
48.520	53.240	To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.

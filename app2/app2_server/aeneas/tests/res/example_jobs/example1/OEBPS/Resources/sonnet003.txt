f000002|Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
f000003|Now is the time that face should form another;
f000004|Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
f000005|Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
f000006|For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
f000007|Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
f000008|Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
f000009|Of his self-love to stop posterity?
f000010|Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
f000011|Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
f000012|So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
f000013|Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
f000014|But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
f000015|Die single and thine image dies with thee.

From fairest creatures we desire increase,
dummy row 2 (2)

That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
dummy row 2 (3)
dummy row 3 (3)

But as the riper should by time decease,
dummy row 2 (4)

His tender heir might bear his memory:

But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,

Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
dummy row 2 (7)
dummy row 3 (7)
dummy row 4 (7)

Making a famine where abundance lies,
dummy row 2 (8)

Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,

And only herald to the gaudy spring,
dummy row 2 (11)

Within thine own bud buriest thy content,

And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

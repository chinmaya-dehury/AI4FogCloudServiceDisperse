1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
From fairest creatures we desire increase,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,240
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,920
But as the riper should by time decease,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,280
His tender heir might bear his memory:

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,880
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,760
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,680
Making a famine where abundance lies,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,240
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,440
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,960
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,680
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,480
And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,080
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,240
To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.

And your days are just about over.

Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

to vinegar... it does.

You came close,
